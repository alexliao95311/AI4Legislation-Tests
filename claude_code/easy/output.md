I'll create a Python function that checks if a string is a palindrome while ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case differences.## How the Solution Works

Let me break down the `is_palindrome` function step by step:

**Step 1: Clean the Input String**
```python
cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
```
This line does three important things:
- `char.isalnum()` - keeps only letters and numbers, removing spaces and punctuation
- `char.lower()` - converts all letters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
- `''.join()` - combines all the cleaned characters back into a single string

For example: "A man a plan a canal Panama" becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama"

**Step 2: Compare with Reverse**
```python
return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]
```
- `cleaned[::-1]` creates a reversed copy of the cleaned string using Python's slice notation
- We compare the original cleaned string with its reverse
- If they're identical, it's a palindrome!

**Why This Approach Works:**
- **Simple and readable**: The logic is easy to follow
- **Handles edge cases**: Empty strings and single characters work correctly
- **Efficient**: We only make one pass through the string to clean it
- **Robust**: Ignores all the things that shouldn't matter (spaces, punctuation, case)

**Key Python Concepts Used:**
- **List comprehension**: `(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())`
- **String methods**: `isalnum()` and `lower()`
- **Slice notation**: `[::-1]` to reverse a string
- **String joining**: `''.join()` to combine characters

The test cases cover various scenarios including normal words, sentences with spaces and punctuation, mixed case, numbers, and edge cases like empty strings. This ensures our function works correctly in all situations!
