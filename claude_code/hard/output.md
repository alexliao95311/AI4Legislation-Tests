I'll create a clean and functional to-do list web app with detailed comments to help you understand how it works.## How the To-Do List App Works

I've created a complete to-do list web app with a clean, modern design. Here's how each part works:

### **HTML Structure**
The HTML creates the basic layout with:
- A **header** with the app title
- An **input section** for adding new tasks
- A **task list container** where tasks will appear

### **CSS Styling**
The CSS makes the app look professional with:
- **Modern gradient background** for visual appeal
- **Card-style container** with rounded corners and shadows
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile devices
- **Hover effects** and smooth transitions for interactivity
- **Visual feedback** for completed tasks (strikethrough, different colors)

### **JavaScript Functionality**

**1. Data Storage**
```javascript
let tasks = [];  // Array to store all tasks
let taskIdCounter = 1;  // Unique ID for each task
```

**2. Adding Tasks (`addTask` function)**
- Gets text from the input field
- Validates that it's not empty
- Creates a new task object with ID, text, and completion status
- Adds it to the tasks array
- Clears the input and updates the display

**3. Toggling Tasks (`toggleTask` function)**
- Finds the task by its ID
- Flips its completed status (true ↔ false)
- Updates the display

**4. Deleting Tasks (`deleteTask` function)**
- Removes the task from the array using `filter()`
- Updates the display

**5. Rendering Tasks (`renderTasks` function)**
- Clears the current task list
- Shows an empty state message if no tasks exist
- Creates HTML for each task with checkbox, text, and delete button
- Uses `escapeHtml()` for security

### **Key Features**

✅ **Add tasks** - Type and click "Add Task" or press Enter
✅ **Mark complete** - Click the checkbox to toggle completion
✅ **Delete tasks** - Click the red "Delete" button
✅ **Visual feedback** - Completed tasks get strikethrough and different colors
✅ **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile
✅ **Clean interface** - Modern, professional appearance
✅ **Security** - Prevents XSS attacks by escaping HTML

### **How to Use**
1. Type a task in the input field
2. Press Enter or click "Add Task" 
3. Click the checkbox to mark tasks as complete
4. Click "Delete" to remove tasks you no longer need

The app stores everything in memory, so tasks will reset when you refresh the page. This keeps it simple for learning purposes, but in a real app, you'd want to save tasks to a database or local storage!
