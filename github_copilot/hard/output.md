Simple To-Do List Web App
Here's a complete to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll create a single HTML file that includes all three components with detailed comments.

How This Code Works - Explanation for Beginners
This to-do list app is built using three core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let me explain how each part works:

HTML Structure
The HTML creates the basic structure of our app
It has a container (div) for the entire app
Inside, we have a heading, a form to add tasks (with an input box and button), and an empty list (ul) where tasks will appear
CSS Styling
The CSS makes the app look good by adding:
Pleasant colors and fonts
Rounded corners and shadows for a modern look
Proper spacing between elements
Visual feedback (like hover effects on buttons)
Strike-through style for completed tasks
JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript makes the app interactive by:

Setting up:

When the page loads, we get references to our HTML elements
We load any previously saved tasks from the browser's localStorage
Adding tasks:

When you click "Add" or press Enter, it takes the text you typed
It creates a new task object with a unique ID, the text, and a "completed" status (initially false)
It adds the task to the list and saves it to localStorage
It clears the input field so you can add another task
Creating task elements:

Each task is represented as a list item with:
A checkbox to mark it complete/incomplete
The task text
A delete button
Managing tasks:

When you check/uncheck a task, it toggles the "completed" styling and updates localStorage
When you delete a task, it removes it from the list and updates localStorage
If all tasks are deleted, it shows a message saying "No tasks yet"
Persistence:

The app saves all tasks to your browser's localStorage
This means your tasks will still be there even if you close the browser or refresh the page
The tasks are stored as JSON (a text format for data)
Key Programming Concepts
Event Listeners: The app responds to user actions (clicks, keypresses) using event listeners

DOM Manipulation: JavaScript creates, modifies, and removes HTML elements dynamically

Data Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser using localStorage

Functions: The code is organized into separate functions that each handle specific tasks

Conditional Logic: The app uses "if" statements to make decisions (like whether to add a task)

To use this app, just save this code to an HTML file and open it in your web browser!
