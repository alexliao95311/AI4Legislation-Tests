Of course! Here's a Python function called `is_palindrome` that takes in a 
string as input and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and 
`False` otherwise:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Ignore spaces, punctuation, and case
    s = s.strip()
    s = s.lower()
    
    # Check if the string is the same when read forward and backward
    return s == s[::-1]
```
Explanation:

* We start by stripping off any spaces, punctuation, and case from the 
input string using the `strip()` method. This ensures that we're comparing 
the correct characters without any extraneous stuff getting in the way.
* Next, we convert the string to lowercase using the `lower()` method. 
This is because palindromes are defined as strings that are spelled the 
same forward and backward, regardless of case.
* Finally, we use the built-in `[::-1]` syntax to check if the string is 
the same when read forward and backward. If it is, then the string is a 
palindrome and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

Here are some example test cases to try:
```python
print(is_palindrome("racecar")) # Should print True
print(is_palindrome("level")) # Should print False
print(is_palindrome("radar")) # Should print True
print(is_palindrome("snow")) # Should print False
```
Note that this implementation only works for strings of letters (i.e., it 
doesn't handle numbers or other non-alphanumeric characters). If you want 
to handle more complex inputs, you can modify the function accordingly.
